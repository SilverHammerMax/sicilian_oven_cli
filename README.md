# Italy: The Game

Welcome to Italy: The Game. This game is an extension of the traveling salesman's problem: you will be given a set numer of cities, and you will have to find the quickest path through them. You 
can play against your friends or preset challenges, as well as just playing against yourself. This game takes place in the South of Italy, and a map is attached to guide you around.

In this guide, we will cover the following 6 chapters:

1. [The Map](#the-map)
2. [Basic Gameplay](#basic-gameplay)
3. [Challenges](#challenges)
4. [Car Building](#car-building)
5. [Repairing, Refuelling, and Road Types](#repairing-refuelling-and-road-types)
6. [Player vs. Player](#player-vs-player)

## The Map

Before discussing anything else, it's important to discuss the map:

### max please insert the map here because i am stupid and don't know how <3

The map covers 8 regions of Italy, with cities and routes placed across the entirety of the map. There are two very important distinctions to make with the map when you're using it:


1. The distinction between different kinds of [roads](#repairing-refuelling-and-road-types). There are five kinds of roads: highway, asphalt, stone, unpaved, and ferry. Each of these roads will result in a different travel time for every car, except
   the ferry; a ferry connection will always take the exact same amount of time regardless of the car. Certain cars might go quicker than others on highway and asphalt roads, while the reverse might be
   true on stone and unpaved roads. The way the car was built has a major effect on a car's performance on a given road, but we'll get into that later. Use the legend to differentiate between the different roads.
2. The distinction between a major and a minor city. A major city, as marked in the legend, is a location where you can [repair or refuel](#repairing-refuelling-and-road-types) your car (the mechanics of which will be explained later) and are frequently
   reference points for starting or ending a possible challenge (which will also be explained later). A major city is noticeably larger than a minor city, and always has a bright red outline. Minor cities might
   have different outlines depending on what roads connect to them. The legend should clearly mark all the possible options for how a city will look.

The legend, on the left-hand side of the map, notes all the different kinds of roads and cities as well as listing the name of each of the 8 regions. It's important to note that distance in-game might
not exactly correlate to the distance on the map. It's also important to note that visible geographical features (such as mountains or mountain ranges) have no bearing on any time calculations. However,
there is an increased amount of stone and unpaved roads in the more mountainous areas.

## Basic Gameplay

Welcome to Italy: The Game! You can use the arrow keys to navigate this and all other menus.
Some might ask you to select an input with your Y or N keys to signify yes or no respectively. The menu system itself should be fairly intuitive.
Once you start the game, you should be presented with three basic options:

> 1. Would you like to start a challenge?
> 2. Would you like to build a car?
> 3. Would you like to play against another player?

We'll cover all of these options in the further chapters, but for now let's assume you want to drive around, free of expectations of requirements. Select "1. Would you like to start a challenge?" and
select the "Free Play" mode. There, you can select a car and a major city to begin from. If you've not already built a car, you can simply select a pre-built one. This mode will enable you to drive around.
Below is an example of a dialogue option.

> Welcome to Ragusa!
>
> Your current time is 0 hour(s) and 0 minute(s)!
>
> Your fuel is 26.
>
> Your path has been: ["Ragusa"]
>
> Your current list of missing cities is: []
>
> Where would you like to go?:
> 
>  - Go to Marina di Ragusa, 33 km
>  - Go to Modica, 11 km
>  - Go to Comiso, 8 km
>  - Go to Giarratana, 17 km
>  - Submit your challenge or return to main menu
>  - Refuel
>  - Repair your car

The menu has 5 main parts. The first part welcomes you to whatever city you are in. The second part tells you how long you've spent driving. The third part tells you how many liters of fuel you have
left in your car. For every turn you take, your fuel will drop by a fixed amount proportional to how large the engine you selected is. For example, if you select a 1.6 Liter engine, you will lose 1.6
liters of fuel. So your fuel would go from 26 to 24.4. If the amount of fuel you have in your car drops below 0, you must restart.
   
The fourth part of the menu lists your path up until that point. It will include all the cities you've travelled to and any refuelling/repair stops you may have made. The fifth part of the menu tells
you your list of missing cities. During [challenges](#challenges) or [Player vs. Player](#player-vs-player), you'll have a set amount of cities you have to travel to, and the "missing cities" list will make sure you stay informed of what
cities you need to travel to.

<p>Finally, the sixth part of the menu offers you options. You must select one to continue. You will have, at most, four different kinds of options: </p>

1. An option to travel to another city. This option will list the city and the distance to that city. You can use the map to check where that city is, whether or not you would like to go to that city, and what
   kind of road connects the city you're currently at and your target city.
2. An option to "Submit your challenge or return to main menu". By selecting this option, you are either submitting your [challenge](#challenges) or returning to the main menu. Make absolutely sure your challenge is complete
   before clicking this button: there is no way to go back.
3. An option to refuel. This option will only be available at major cities, and it will allow you to [refuel your car.
4. An option to repair your car. This option will also only be available at major cities, and it will allow you to [repair your car](#repairing-refuelling-and-road-types).

There may also occasionally be a part of the menu that gives you a warning for low fuel. This warning will intuitively only appear when you are low on fuel. There may also be a text that tells you that
your challenge is complete, although this would only come up during challenge mode. This is your signal to select the "submit your challenge" dialogue option.

When playing the game, remember that the goal is to go as fast as possible. This means trying to minimize time spent refuelling and going between cities. Remember that you lose fuel at a set amount per
turn and that distance does NOT impact fuel usage. It might seem counter-intuitive, but traveling 20 kilometers from city A to city B while going through city C uses more fuel than traveling 30 kilometers
going from city A to city B. The actual time spent between cities corresponds to a complicated formula that's expanded on in chapter 5. The same applies to the car's condition, which will also be expanded
on in chapter 5.
